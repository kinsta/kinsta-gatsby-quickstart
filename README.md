### Setting the Build Command, Node version, and Publish directory

After connecting the repository, **Static Site Hosting** will automatically populate all the fields with the correct values.
| Configuration option |Value     |
| ----------------- | --------------- |
| Build command     | `npm run build` |
| Node version      | 18.16.0         |
